## str.split()

The `split()` method splits a string into a list.

### Syntax
```python
string.split(separator, maxsplit)
```

### Parameters
- separator (optional): Specifies the separator to use
- maxsplit (optional): Specifies how many splits to do

### Example
```python
text = "Hello World"
result = text.split()
print(result)  # ['Hello', 'World']
```

## str.join()

The `join()` method joins elements of an iterable into a string.

Q: What is supervised learning?
A: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained
on labeled data. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs and can make
predictions on new, unseen data.

Q: What is unsupervised learning?
A: Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data. The algorithm
must find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance.

Q: What are neural networks?
A: Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks.
They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information.
